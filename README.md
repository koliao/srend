# Srend

A basic CPU 3D renderer for learning purposes

<img src="srend.gif"/>

Uses love2d only to draw a texture but the texture is controlled 100% in the cpu

- It's really slow
- It doesn't support textures
- It doesn't support projections (other than orthographic)
- Basic directional lighting model

It requires love2d 11.5, to run just execute `love .` inside the repo
